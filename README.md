PupilPC
==========

  This project is to allow a paralyzed person use a computer by relying on his/her pupil movements. An IR camera is used to capture the movements of the pupil and map it to the movements of the mouse cursor.
  
Instructions to run:
====================

  Connect the IR camera to the computer, then run pupil.py. On running, if the IR camera is working and you see a pair of calibration windows then everything is working fine. Press 'C' and perform the calibration in order for the program to get familiar with the screen size and the user's eyes. Once the calibration is done, you can control the mouse based on how your eye moves. Focussing your eyes approximately at some point for around 3 seconds will click at that point.
  
  Pressing 'k' should open a virtual keyboard, which will allow the person to type using his eyes. The typing is made easy by changing the colour of the button where the mouse hovers over so that it becomes easier for a person to focus on a button, this way clicking the button becomes easier. This was seen in a current research which proved that it becomes easier for a person to focus on a point if there is some change at that position, this change in position is brought about by making the colour of the button change.
  
In slower machines:
===================
  
  Pressing 'k' may crash the entire program, in such a case you will have to run keyboard.py along with pupil for the process to work.
